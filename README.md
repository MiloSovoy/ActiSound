ActiSound
=========

Activator gesture to play sound.

Anyone willing to make me an icon or help with this tweak, by all means feel free to do so!

Special thanks to Phillip Tennen/Codyd51 and Steve Rolfe/Chewmieser for their code from CallNow and FreeFall, which was extensively used in this tweak.
